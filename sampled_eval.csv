As a lead discipline engineer, I am client facing and adapt well to the constantly changing personalities of clients and give their projects my full attention. Often these projects are deep in scope and, due to layouts and preexisting configurations, are rarely similar. Thus each project requires synchronization between multiple disciplines and contractors. Because of the unknown nature of each project, I believe my communication, time management, and ability to cope with stress are extremely valuable abilities.
